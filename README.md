# number-to-french-converter
## About the project
This project aims at converting numbers ranging from 0 to 999 999 to French.

## Expected behavior
Given a list of integers comprised within the 0-999999 range, outputs the list of converted numbers in French.
For example, given the list of integers `[1, 2, 3]`, the script should output `["un", "deux", "trois"]`.

## Usage
Run either one of these two commands:\
`python3 run.py --number-list="[1, 2, 3]"`\
or\
`python3 run.py --n "[1, 2, 3]"`

You can edit the list with the desired integers.
